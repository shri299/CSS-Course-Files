<!-- html (hypertext markup language), used to structure content in a web page -->
<!-- A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within 
a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather
 than typical programming syntax. While several markup languages exist, the two most
  popular are HTML and XML. -->
  <!-- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
  HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. -->

<!-- css(cascading style sheets) use css to style our webpage -->
<!-- CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>   <!-- defines that this is html5 document -->
<html lang="en"> <!--Root Element, the language in use is english-->
