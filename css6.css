/* css positioning and layout

HTML elements are positioned static by default.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause
it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.


An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in
the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

absolute: moves wrt parent where parent is also given some position property other than static.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative
until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed). */
